This template demonstrates how to use the [ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/) in a CDN application.

To quickly scaffold a new application using this template, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npx @arcgis/create -n my-arcgis-app -t cdn
```

`<script type="module" src="https://js.arcgis.com/5.0/"></script>` will load all the necessary packages used in the template.

See the [Get started with CDN guide](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/web-components/get-started/#create-an-app-with-the-arcgis-cdn) for full setup instructions.
