The sample demonstrates how to build an interactive scene-driven layout where UI controls dynamically manage layer visibility and filtering using the ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript and Calcite Design System in a Vite based application.

The layout focuses on showing how a sidebar control panel can drive scene content in real time.

## Key features

- Integrating a 3D SceneView with dynamic UI controls
- Building a sidebar control panel using Calcite components
- Toggling layer visibility based on checkbox state
- Applying client-side filtering
- Interactive and responsive scene experience

## Running the app

1. Install dependencies: `npm i`
2. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
3. _Optionally_, if building and testing production apps, run `npm run build && npm run preview`
