Demonstrates a finder-style application layout built with React, ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript, ArcGIS Maps SDK Web Components, and Calcite components.

The app combines a searchable and sortable results list with an interactive map and a drill-down detail view using `calcite-flow`.

## Key features

- Styled features use a unique value renderer based on cluster
- Drill-down details using a flow-based UI
- Uses Calcite's Shell, Shell Panel, and Flow
- Filtering and sorting results
- Synchronizing list selection with map interaction
- Applying zoom extent based on selected data

## Running the app

1. Install dependencies: `npm i`
2. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
3. _Optionally_, if building and testing production apps, run `npm run build && npm run preview`
